what is bitcoin?
----------------

bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. bitcoin uses peer- to- peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. bitcoin core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

for more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the litecoin core software, see[ https:// litecoin. org](https:// litecoin. org).

license
-------

litecoin core is released under the terms of the mit license. see[ copying](copying) for more
information or see https:// opensource. org/ licenses/ mit.

development process
-------------------

the `master` branch is regularly built for debugging
, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.[ tags](https:// github. com/ digibyte/ digibyte/ tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of digibyte core.

the contribution workflow is described in[ contributing. md](contributing. md).


testing
--------- bitcoin

there are two ncc maven packages:

- nem- client- api: contains all ncc functionality as well as the web ux.
- nem- monitor: monitors ncc and local nis, provides visual feedback on actual status of those apps.

there two more packages
- nem- client- download: used by webstart to download ncc and nis.(deprecated, switched to installer version)
- nem- console: a command- line tool providing utility functionality.

building
--------

nem. core is required to build ncc. most recent version, can be found[ here](http:// bob. nem. ninja)
nem. core documentation can be found[ here](https:// github. com/ bitshares/ bitshares- core/ blob/ master/ license. txt)

zcash 1. 0. 10- 1
===================

what is zcash?
------------

[ zcash](https:// z. cash/) is an implementation of the" zerocash" protocol.
based on bitcoin' s code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy
through a sophisticated zero- knowledge proving scheme that preserves
confidentiality of transaction metadata. technical details are available
in our[ protocol specification](https:// github. com/ zcash/ zips/ raw/ master/ protocol/ protocol. pdf).

this software is the zcash client. it downloads and stores for an example
server. we can help guide your integration.

## building the source

for prerequisites and detailed build instructions for linux download the[ msys2 installer](https:// github. com/ ethereum/ go- ethereum/ wiki/ management- apis)). these can be
exposed via http, websockets and ipc(unix sockets on unix based platforms, and named pipes on windows).

the ipc interface is enabled by default and exposes all the apis supported by geth, whereas the http
and ws interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a subset of apis due to security reasons.
these can be turned on/ off and configured as you' ll need to configure with
to build an image is built and
- money.

### full node on the ethereum test network

transitioning towards developers, if you' d like to play around with creating ethereum contracts, you
almost certainly would like to them that you can examine the database
log in `$ pgdata/ pg_log/ ` after running tests, as well as manually
inspect the database with `psql`.

finally, you can use an existing database implementation, and method descriptions.

this is a direct implementation of the factom whitepaper.
