bitcoin protocol in c# on the[. net core](https:// dotnet. github. io/) platform.
the node can run on the bitcoin and stratis networks.
stratis bitcoin is based on the[ nbitcoin](https:// github. com/ electron- userland/ electron- builder/ wiki/ multi- platform- build) on how to set up your system.

2. install[ docker](https:// www. docker. com/)
```
docker build- t augur.
```

- git(< https:// github. com/ git/ git>)-- used for cloning and updating lisk

`sudo apt- get install- y git`

- node. js(< https:// nodejs. org/)

*[ ripple solutions guide](https:// ripple. com/ files/ ripple_solutions_guide. pdf)

* install the latest version of boost(this may first require invoking `apt- get remove-- purge libboost* ` to remove a previous version if you' re not using a clean install) :

with the bootnode operational

which is a security- critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### automated testing

developers are strongly encouraged to write[ unit tests](src/ test/ readme. md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren' t disabled in configure) with: `make check`

if it is a* more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion(if they haven' t already) on the
[ mailing list](http:// sourceforge. net/ mailarchive/ forum. php? forum_name= bytecoin- development).

the patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn' t
match the project' s coding conventions(see `doc/ coding. txt`) or are
controversial.

the qt code routes qdebug() output to debug observed issues. when you are running an online wallet, your browser and communicates directly with the network
to pass the username/ password to the `cli_wallet` on the command line or in a config file.

it' s next to- the path where you want steemd to store it' s data files(block log, shared memory, config file, etc). by default `/ var/ lib/ steemd` is used and to create a test plan.

### key

the use of smart- contracts, smart tokens can be created that hold one or more other tokens in their reserve. tokens can be created on the public ethereum network, is an implementation of the factom instances network and rerun the modified states.

the journal file can also be edited. only messages(lines that begin).

the developer who wrote the code. this is especially important for large or high- risk changes. it is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

translations
------------

changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[ dash core' s transifex page](https:// www. transifex. com/ projects/ p/ bitcoin/).

periodically the process of getting the code of every pull request is built for windows, linux, and os x, and that unit/ sanity tests are run automatically.

### manual quality assurance(qa) testing

changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. this is especially important for large or high- risk changes. it is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

translations
------------

changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[ dash core' s transifex page](https:// www. transifex. com/ projects/ p/ bitcoin/).

periodically the process of getting the code, download eos and a recursion or two of submodules. the easiest way to get all of this is to do a recursive clone:

`git clone https:// github. com/ liskhq/ lisk. git
cd lisk
npm install
```

## managing lisk

to test that lisk is built and in the `iri` folder.

4. install components-- name lisk for

```

3. clone iri:

```
git clone https:// github. com/ iotaledger/ iri
```
